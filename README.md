# QTheory

Design & code by Dr. Jordi Weiss.

Based on the "Operations Management" course by Prof. Suzanne de Treville at the University of Lausanne around 2015 to 2022.

QTheory is a simulation-game I developed at the University of Lausanne with Prof. Suzanne de Treville to illustrate the queuing theory aspects of the course. 

### Basic intro:
You manage a system, like the service counters at the Post office for example, with customers arriving at a certain interval and coming to the servers (the employees for example) for a service that will take a certain time.

Your goal is to play with service time, inter-arrival time of customers, the number of servers and the queuing system, to manage the waiting time.

Each customer is represented as a white circle, with its individual waiting time indicated inside it.
The number of customers currently in the system is indicated on the graph.
